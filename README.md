# Calculight
Calculight - quick calculation tool.
Phone user will be able to easily calculate any expression on the phone just by selecting it without opening a calculator app.
After selecting the expression and pressing "copy" button, the result of calculation will be shown on the screen and can be pasted
wherever user wants to. 
Our calculate function will be able to calculate not only expressions such as "1+3", but also letter expressions such as 
"one+two", "1 + three" and so on. Later the same idea can integrated into iOS devices as well. 
The idea was recently patented in November, 2015, Seoul.
